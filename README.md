# Unit 1

## What This Does

<!-- Three or four sentences. Which corpus you picked, and the kinds of
     questions your system answers. Write it for someone who has never seen
     this repo.

     Milestone 5. -->

## Chunking Strategy

**Chunk size:**
**Overlap:**

<!-- What about YOUR documents made you pick these numbers? Short posts and
     long sectioned guides don't want the same chunking, and "800 seemed
     reasonable" earns nothing. Point at something you noticed when you read
     the documents in Milestone 1.

     If you changed your mind partway through, say so and say why. That's worth
     more than pretending you got it right first time.

     Milestone 3. -->

## Sample Chunks

<!-- Five chunks, pasted as text. Label each one and name the file it came from
     AND the function that produced it — the grader checks your code against
     what you claim here.

     `python app.py chunks -n 5` prints all three for you. Copy them straight
     across.

     Milestone 3. -->

**Chunk 1** — source: `admin_add_drop_deadline.txt#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
On the add/drop deadline

You can add a course through the end of the second week. Dropping is a longer window — through the end of week six — but a drop after week two shows as a W on your transcript. Nothing anywhere on the registrar's site says this plainly, and students find out from each other.
```

**Chunk 2** — source: `course_biol_160_exams.txt#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
BIOL 160 Cell Biology — assessment

Four unit tests and a cumulative final. Not curved.

The unit tests come fast, roughly every three weeks; falling behind once is very hard to recover from.
```

**Chunk 3** — source: `course_math_220.txt#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
MATH 220 Linear Algebra

I lived here my sophomore year. Format is chalk-and-talk lecture, weekly problem sets marked for correctness. Assessment: two midterms and a cumulative final. Curved to a b- median.

Expect 6 to 8 hours a week, almost all of it on problem sets.

The one piece of advice: the problem sets are the course; the lectures make sense afterwards rather than during.
```

**Chunk 4** — source: `dining_the_ridgeway_cafe.txt#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
The Ridgeway Café

Second-year here. Wait times: 10 to 15 minutes at 12:30, none after 2:00. The thing worth going for is the only place on campus with real espresso. The thing to know is that seating is tight; about 40 seats for a building of 900.

Hours are 7:00am to 4:00pm weekdays only. Costs declining balance only, no meal swipes.
```

**Chunk 5** — source: `housing_innisfree_hall_laundry.txt#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
Laundry in Innisfree Hall

Machines take $1.75 wash, $1.75 dry, app-based. There are eight washers and six dryers for the building, which is the wrong ratio and means the dryers back up on Sunday evenings.

Best time to do laundry here is Tuesday or Wednesday morning. Sunday after 6pm you will wait.
```

All five above are documents that stayed whole under the 350-character ceiling
(88 of 88 documents fit one chunk under the starter's numbers; 77 still do under
mine). For a document the chunker actually split, here are both chunks of
`transit_shuttle.txt` — the title line is re-prepended to the second chunk
because its body never says the word "shuttle":

**Split example, chunk a** — source: `transit_shuttle.txt#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
The campus shuttle

Runs a loop every 20 minutes from 7am to 11pm on weekdays and every 40 minutes on weekends. The published timetable is optimistic by about five minutes in the morning and accurate the rest of the day.
```

**Split example, chunk b** — source: `transit_shuttle.txt#1` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
The campus shuttle

It's free with a student ID. The stop outside Fenwick Court is the one that gets skipped when the driver is behind, which is worth knowing if you live there.
```

## Sample Answer

<!-- One complete question and answer, pasted as text, with the source line
     visible. Milestone 4. -->

**Question:**

**Answer:**

```
```

**My relevance cutoff:**

<!-- The number you set in config.py, and how you got there.

     You ran five questions your corpus covers and the five in OUT_OF_SCOPE
     that it clearly doesn't, and wrote down the best distance for each. What
     did those two groups look like? Where was the gap? Put the actual numbers
     here — the table below wants all ten rows.

     Milestone 4. -->

| Question | In corpus? | Best distance |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------- |
|          |            |               |

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. For each: what you asked for, what came back, and
     what you changed about it.

     "I asked Claude to write the chunking function from my notes. It ignored
     the overlap, so I added that myself" is the level of detail we're after.
     "I used AI to help me code" is not.

# Unit 2

<!-- These sections get ADDED to what's already above. Don't delete or rewrite
     unit 1 — the point is that someone can see what you said before you knew
     how it went. -->

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Your five criteria, three runs each. `python run_eval.py --label before`
     runs the questions, puts the OUT_OF_SCOPE ones through the gate, and
     writes it all into results/ for you. Targets come from criteria.md; the
     verdict column is your call.

     Criterion 3 is measured in one deterministic pass rather than three, so
     the same number goes in all three run columns. That's correct, not lazy.

     Milestone 1. -->

| Criterion                              | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
| -------------------------------------- | ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------- |
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |       |       |       |         |
| 2. Every answer names a source         | 5 of 5 |       |       |       |         |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions  | 4 of 5 |       |       |       |         |
| 4.                                     |        |       |       |       |         |
| 5.                                     |        |       |       |       |         |

<!-- Underneath, paste the REAL output for each criterion from one of your
     runs — the actual text your system produced, not a description of it.
     Name the file and function that produced it. -->

## Verdicts

<!-- MET or MISSED for each of the five, against the target you wrote last
     unit — not a new one. Plus a sentence on how you decided. That sentence
     matters most where it was close.

     If your target said 4 of 5 and your runs came out 4, 3, 4, that's a MISS.
     The target has to hold, not show up occasionally.

     Milestone 2. -->

| # | Criterion | Verdict | How I decided |
| - | --------- | ------- | ------------- |
| 1 |           |         |               |
| 2 |           |         |               |
| 3 |           |         |               |
| 4 |           |         |               |
| 5 |           |         |               |

## Diagnoses

<!-- For each miss: which stage caused it, and how. The stage alone isn't
     enough — you need the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis: "Question 3 didn't work."
     A diagnosis:     "Question 3 asks about laundry costs. The answer is in
                       one sentence that got split across two chunks, so
                       neither chunk on its own contains it."

     The five stages: loading → chunking → embedding → retrieval → generation.

     Look for a pattern. If three misses all ask about numbers, that's one
     problem, not three.

     Missed nothing? Say so, then say honestly whether your targets were set
     low, and which one you'd tighten and to what.

     Milestone 3. -->

## The Improvement

**What I changed:**

**Why I picked it:**

<!-- Connect it to a specific diagnosis above in one sentence. If you can't,
     you picked a fix because it sounded impressive. -->

### Run Log — After

<!-- Same format, same five criteria, three runs each.
     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

| Criterion                              | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
| -------------------------------------- | ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------- |
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |       |       |       |         |
| 2. Every answer names a source         | 5 of 5 |       |       |       |         |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions  | 4 of 5 |       |       |       |         |
| 4.                                     |        |       |       |       |         |
| 5.                                     |        |       |       |       |         |

**Did it help?**

<!-- Say plainly whether it did, and how you know. If it made things worse,
     say that — a change that backfired, honestly reported, earns full credit
     and is more interesting than one that worked. What matters is that you can
     tell.

     Milestone 4. -->

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed after your fix: what you'd do about it,
     and why you stopped where you did.

     "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is left is
     not.

     Milestone 5. -->

## What I'd Do Differently

<!-- Knowing what you know now — which of your five criteria would you write
     differently, and why?

     Milestone 5. -->
